# C++ File System Navigator ðŸ“‚

A simple file system navigator implemented in C++ as a weekend hobby project. The main aim of this project is to gain more experience programming in C++ and hopefully learn something new about file systems as well. The navigator offers essential file system commands for navigation and management, including `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `undo/redo` and more.

## Functionality

- `cp` Copy files or directories.
- `Undo/Redo:` Support undo and redo functionalities for file operations.
- Viewing the contents of text files within the terminal.
- Search for files or directories within the current directory.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the project using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable file.
4. Utilize the provided commands to navigate and manage the file system.
